Task Master - User Registration
Welcome to the Task Master repository! This project is a part of my journey to master web development using the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express, React, Node.js).

🚀 Overview
The Task Master app is a task management application where users can register, log in, manage their tasks, and now includes a logout functionality. The project currently focuses on the user registration system, allowing users to create accounts and sign up for the application.

🛠️ Technologies Used
React - Frontend library for building the user interface.
Redux - State management for handling user authentication states.
Axios - HTTP client for making requests to the backend.
Node.js - Backend server running Express.js.
MongoDB - Database for storing user information and tasks.
JWT (JSON Web Token) - For user authentication and session management.
📦 Features
User Registration: Allows users to register by providing their username, email, password, and selecting a role (User/Admin).
Error Handling: Displays relevant error messages in case of registration failure.
Form Validation: Ensures the proper format of email and password input.
User Logout: Users can now log out of the application, invalidating their current session.
CORS Issue Fix: Fixed issues related to CORS (Cross-Origin Resource Sharing) to ensure smooth communication between frontend and backend during development
