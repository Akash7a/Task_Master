# Task Master - User Registration

Welcome to the **Task Master** repository! This project is a part of my journey to master web development using the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express, React, Node.js).

The **Task Master** app is a task management application where users can register, log in, and manage their tasks. This project currently focuses on the **user registration system**, allowing users to create accounts and sign up for the application.

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

- **React** - Frontend library for building the user interface.
- **Redux** - State management for handling user authentication states.
- **Axios** - HTTP client for making requests to the backend.
- **Node.js** - Backend server running Express.js.
- **MongoDB** - Database for storing user information and tasks.
- **JWT (JSON Web Token)** - For user authentication and session management.

## 📦 Features
